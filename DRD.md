1. Introduction
The FitFaster App is a comprehensive fitness application designed to empower users in achieving their health and fitness goals. The app focuses on providing users with tools for detailed nutrition tracking, workout logging, supplement management, and gamification to enhance user engagement and motivation. Unlike traditional fitness apps that offer pre-determined meal plans, FitFaster allows users to manually input their meals, customize meal plans, and receive portion size suggestions based on their goals, similar to the functionality offered by MyFitnessPal.
