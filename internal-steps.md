# FitFaster Development Progress

## IMPORTANT NOTE TO DEVELOPERS

This document outlines both completed work and future development steps. When implementing new features:

1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: All existing features must remain intact. The codebase has been carefully structured with type safety, testing, and error handling in mind. Any modifications to existing code should maintain or enhance these standards.

2. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
   - Use the existing component structure
   - Maintain strict TypeScript usage (no 'any' types)
   - Follow the testing patterns in place
   - Use the established error handling mechanisms
   - Adhere to the existing styling approach with NativeWind

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - All new features must include unit tests
   - Update existing tests if modifying current functionality
   - Maintain or improve current test coverage

4. **Development Flow**:
   - Create feature branches from main
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Add tests before submitting PRs
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Update documentation as needed

5. **Code Review Checklist**:
   - Type safety maintained
   - Tests added/updated
   - Existing functionality preserved
   - Documentation updated
   - Performance considerations addressed

Remember: The goal is to extend functionality while maintaining the integrity and stability of the existing codebase.
