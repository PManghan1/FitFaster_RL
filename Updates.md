### Integrate Sentry for Error Monitoring

**To find your Sentry DSN:**

1. **Log in to Sentry:**
   - Visit [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Your Project:**
   - From the dashboard, select the project you want to integrate with your application.

3. **Access Project Settings:**
   - In the project sidebar, click on **Settings**.

4. **Locate Client Keys (DSN):**
   - Under the **Client Keys (DSN)** section, you will find your DSN.
   - Click on the **Show DSN** button if it's hidden.

5. **Copy the DSN:**
   - Copy the DSN value provided.

**Important:**
- **Keep Your DSN Secure:** Do not expose your DSN in public repositories or client-side code that can be accessed by end-users.
- **Environment Variables:** Store your DSN in environment variables to keep it secure. For example, you can add it to your `.env` file:
  ```env
  SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-here
  ```
- **Initialize Sentry in Your Application:**
  - After obtaining the DSN, initialize Sentry in your application's entry point (e.g., `App.tsx`):
    ```typescript
    import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

    Sentry.init({
      dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
      // Additional configuration options
    });
    ```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Sentry into your application for enhanced error monitoring and reporting.
